Android Mock is a wrapper for EasyMock (2.4) which allows for real Class mocking on
an Android (Dalvik) VM.

All methods on Android Mock are syntactically equivalent to EasyMock method
calls, and will delegate calls to EasyMock, while performing the required
transformations to avoid Dalvik VM troubles.

Calls directly to EasyMock will work correctly only if the Class being mocked
is in fact an Interface. Calls to Android Mock will work correctly for both
Interfaces and concrete Classes.

Android Mock requires that the code being mocked be instrumented prior to
loading to the Dalvik VM by having called the MockGenerator.jar file. Try
running java -jar MockGenerator.jar --help for more information.

An example usage pattern is:

@UsesMocks(MyClass.class)
public void testFoo() MyClass {
  mockObject = AndroidMock.createMock(MyClass.class);
  AndroidMock.expect(mockObject.foo(0)).andReturn(42);
  AndroidMock.replay(mockObject); assertEquals(42, mockObject.foo(0));
  AndroidMock.verify(mockObject);
}
